## Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms

Big O notation, It provides an upper bound on the running time or space requirements of an algorithm as a function of the input size (n). This helps in analyzing how the performance of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.

## Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations

-Best Case: The scenario where the search operation takes the minimum possible time. For example, in a linear search, the best case occurs when the target element is the first element in the array.

-Average Case: The expected time taken for a search operation when considering all possible positions of the target element within the array.

-Worst Case: The scenario where the search operation takes the maximum possible time. For example, in a linear search, the worst case occurs when the target element is the last element in the array or not present at all.

## Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms
Linear Search: O(n) - In the worst case, every element in the array must be checked

Binary Search: O(log n) - In the worst case, the size of the search interval is halved with each step, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity

## Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why
For an e-commerce platform:
-Linear Search is simple and does not require the array to be sorted. However, it is inefficient for large datasets.
-Binary Search is more efficient for large datasets but requires the array to be sorted.
